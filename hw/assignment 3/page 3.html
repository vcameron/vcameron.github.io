        <h2> Writing Sample #1 </h2>
        <p> <strong> This writing sample is an excerpt from a final essay that I wrote for my Biodiversity class in 2014. The assignment asked us to pick a topic that we were passionate about and show how it related to biodiversity. I chose to write about fashion designers who had been inspired by biodiversity. </strong></p>
          Designers frequently find inspiration for their collections in nature. The natural variety of colors, patterns, and textures found around the world serve as an endless spring of creativity from which designers can draw from. In discussing her Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2013-14 collection, notable Dutch fashion designer Iris Van Herpen commented that organisms and their exoskeletons greatly inspired her collection’s latex, laser-cut dresses and 3D-printed heels. The chunky, treacherously tall 3D-printed heels that she showed appear to be made of entangled pieces of bone: an ode to the beautiful intricacy of animal exoskeletons. A dress is enveloped in nude feathers, birds that appear to be in flight protruding from each shoulder.
        <p> The late Alexander McQueen was also incredibly inspired by nature throughout the course of his career. McQueen upheld the belief that nature itself was a work of art and his collections frequently included looks that drew their designs from nature. One dress from his Spring/Summer 2010 Plato’s Atlantis collection is swathed in snakeskin and looks like a sea animal-snake hyrbrid. McQueen remarked that this collection was inspired both by climate change and our bleak future if we  don’t take action to reverse the damage we’ve done to the Earth. More specifically, he said that his Spring/Summer 2010 collection was about “the reversal of evolution, how life would evolve back into the water if the ice caps melted and we were being reclaimed by nature” (Alexander
          McQueen: Savage Beauty). McQueen’s collection does not just touch on the importance of preserving biodiversity: it shows that the fashion industry can be environmentally, as well as aesthetically, valuable. </p>

        <h3> Writing Sample #2 </h3>
        <p> <strong> This writing sample is an assignment from an Argumentation and Critical Thinking class that I took in Fall 2016. The assignment asked us to write an op-ed on a currently relevant topic of our choosing, so I chose to write about why airlines’ checked baggage fees should be eliminated. </strong> </p>
        <p> If you’ve flown anytime in the past few years, you know that most airlines charge a significant fee for checking your bags. For most of the main commercial airlines, this fee starts at 25 dollars for the first checked bag, and multiplies quickly with each additional bag or bag weighing upwards of 50 pounds that is checked. This makes flying—an event that is already costly enough—even more expensive. What do these expensive checked baggage fees mean for airline passengers? It means flight delays and security delays: a recipe for the inefficient and often stressful experience that is the modern-day airport. </p>
        <p> The first problem is that, to avoid paying the checked baggage fees, more and more passengers opt to carry-on as much baggage onto their flight as they can in order to avoid shelling out extra money. As a result, many passengers either carry on more than the two allowed bags, or bring overstuffed and oversized carry-on bags that are too big to properly fit in the overhead bins. This presents a glaring issue: on full flights, there’s frequently not enough overhead bin space inside the plane to accommodate all of the carry-on baggage. As a result, gate agents are forced to extend the boarding
process in order to check the extra bags that won’t fit. The result? Everyday, countless flights leave later than scheduled. The extended boarding process presents a very real inconvenience to passengers who have short layovers that subsequently have them on tight time constraints. Eliminating the checked baggage fee would mean that the people who carry-on their bags in order to save money on checked baggage fees would likely feel more inclined to check their bags since it wouldn’t cost them extra money. This would potentially free up space in the overhead bins during boarding so that gate agents wouldn’t have to take extra time during the boarding process to check bags that cannot fit inside the plane’s main cabin. </p>
        <p>The second problem with current airline baggage fees is that, because many passengers actively avoid checked baggage fees by only carrying on their bags, security lines today are incredibly long—especially during busy seasons like summer and the winter holidays. This not only unnecessarily elongates the process of getting through the security line for passengers, but makes passengers more likely to miss their flights because of security line delays. Charging passengers for carry-on bags in lieu of charging them for checked baggage would help to further alleviate these delay problems at the security line and flight gates; it would provide passengers with the incentive of saving money by checking their bags.
        <p>Airlines argue that eliminating checked baggage fees would reduce the enormous revenue these fees generate for them. But introducing a fee for carry-on bags would most likely work to counteract these losses. Charging a fee for carry-on bags would both help the flight boarding process run on schedule and alleviate some of the
delays at airport security that are partially a result of checked baggage fees. And to the flyers who argue against airlines charging fees for any kind of baggage—whether it’s carry-on or checked: you’re living in a fantasy land. Airlines have gotten increasingly adept at introducing new fees to raise their revenues and it’s highly unlikely that they’re going to give up their hefty profits anytime soon just for the sake of their passengers’ wallets.</p>
